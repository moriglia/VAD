\section{Usage}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In order to use the Voice Activity Detector component properly,
        it must be clocked at 16\si{\mega\hertz}\footnote{This value has been
        arbitrarily chosen since it was not stated in the requirements. However,
        changing the operating frequency is pretty straightforward since it implies
        just changing the default value of the frame clocker.}, while samples will be fed
        into the VAD at a 16\si{\kilo\hertz} rate.
  \item In order to start feeding a frame into the VAD,
        \texttt{frame\_start} must be raised and kept high for 1 clock cycle
  \item After \texttt{frame\_start} has been raised,
        the first \texttt{x[15 downto 0]} input must be ready by
        and kept at least until the 499th clock.
  \item After the first sample, following samples must be ready by
        and kept until the $(499 + 1000n)$-th clock cycle, where
        $n = 1, \dots, N - 1$
  \item As soon as the threshold is exceeded the output will be raised.
        This means that for early detection (before remaining samples are
        processed) the output of the VAD can be sampled at the
        $(503 + 1000n)$-th clock cycle, with $n = 13, \dots, N - 1$. With fewer
        than 13 samples the partial energy can't be greater than the threshold.
        The output will be ready at last in 255503 clock cycles after having
        raised \texttt{frame\_start} for one clock cycle and will not change
        later on until a new frame is fed into the VAD.
\end{itemize}
